# Training: Git

Welcome to this repository of training materials for using Git to version-control your code.

The training materials will be written in Git Bash so we will mostly be interfacing via the command terminal.

## Who are these training materials for?

In no ways is this training material meant to be a comprehensive nor exhuastive guide. Instead, it is designed with the enterprise/business user in mind.

In particular, it is created from this perspective to enable users to become familiarised with and get-started with using Git.

## References
For a highly-recommended intro to Git, there is a [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) course.
