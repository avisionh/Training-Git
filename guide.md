# Guide
This documents acts as the guide to describe some of the more complex concepts of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## What are branches? ðŸŒ²
A git version-controlled project typically consists of a `master` **branch** and several other **branches**.

Think of it like a tree where the `master` is the trunk and other **branches** are ermm... branches of that tree - they come off the trunk.

Idea is that `master`, the trunk, is where all the work in the **branches** feed into.

In this regard, `master`, should contain **all** finished code that is *perfect*. *Perfect* in the sense that the code existing in `master` works for anybody else who clones the repository. It should not contain experimental work.

## Git, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps: Dafuq?
There are plenty of version-control types of things out there and it can be confusing to distinguish between them.

The difference is that Git is the underlying **version-control system** that these *services* depend on to work effectively.

The following below (some of the most popular but are plenty more out there) are *services* on top of Git that add more functionality to Git, primarily in the form of making it easier to collaborate with others and to host your code online:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [AzureDevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/)

Put another way, Git is local to your computer set-up whereas these *services* are hosted online and allow easy collaboration.

### How does it piece together?

Git outta here and start version-controlling!
