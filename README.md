# Training: Git
Welcome to this repository of training materials for using Git to version-control your code.

The training materials will be written in **Git Bash** so we will mostly be interfacing via the command terminal.

## Who are these training materials for?
In no ways is this training material meant to be a comprehensive nor exhuastive guide. Instead, it is designed with the enterprise/business user in mind.

In particular, it is created from this perspective to enable users to become familiarised with and get-started with using Git.

## Is there anything I need alongside the files?
Yes, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and install it.

## I want to learn more!
Check out the officially recommended [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) ebook!

For the perspective of an R user, there is also the ebook by the excellent Jenny Bryan, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).

## Who can I contact if I think this material is pants? ðŸ‘–
Please post it as an [Issue](https://github.com/avisionh/Training-Git/issues) on this repository. I will then look at it...in due course...
