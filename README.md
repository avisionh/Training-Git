# Training: Git
Welcome to this repository of training materials for using Git to version-control your code.

The training materials will be written in **Git Bash** so we will mostly be interfacing via the command terminal.

## Who are these training materials for?
In no ways is this training material meant to be a comprehensive nor exhuastive guide. Instead, it is designed with the enterprise/business user in mind.

In particular, it is created from this perspective to enable users to creatly familiarise and get-started with using Git. 

## Is there anything I need alongside the files?
Yes, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and install it.

## Who can I contact if I think this material is pants? ðŸ‘–
Please post it as an [Issue](https://github.com/avisionh/Training-Git/issues) on this repository. I will then look at it...in due course...
